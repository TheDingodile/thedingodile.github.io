**Introduction**

Japan is currently one of the countries with the highest life expectancy of all time. The country has had an consistent growth to the top in the last 60 years. In this article we explore the global development of life expectancy with focus on Japan. Get ready for an interactive journey going from a worldwide perspective deepdiving into the fascinating story of Japan. What causes people to live longer? How has particularly Japan unlocked this potential? Is there a limit to to human longevity? 

If these questions whet the appetite, this article is for you.

**The last 60 years globally**

We start off in a broad scope by showing the global development in the last 60 years. [During this period the world-wide life expectancy has increased from 50 years to 72 years.](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/WLD/world/life-expectancy) This remarkable development is particularly due to many countries in Asia, Africa and South America catching up with the western world.

As seen in the world-map it would be considered lucky to live to the age of 30 in some of the undeveloped countries in Africa and even China (Which was during The Great Leap Forward). The life expectancy in these countries is [comparable to the life expectancy in Europe in the 1800s](https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/Eng/Docs/DEIP_Gallop.pdf). Like the time back in Europe, the low life expectancy is due to [high infant mortality](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1072803/child-mortality-rate-africa-historical/) and a high risk of dying from infectious diseases. Clearly, if you are unfortunate enough to die as a child, you will drag down the average life expectancy by a large margin. In a country where people die at age 80 on average, it would take 4 people to live to the age of 100 just to outweight the death of one child. This next plot demonstrates how infant mortality rate is the first and biggest decider when it comes to increasing life expectancy.

All of the relatively less developed countries shown, India, Brazil and South Africa, has the same trend in 1960. There is a sharp drop in survival rate for the first 5 years of a childs life. This trend is similar to what is seen in Denmark around 1900 (Which also is toggle-able in the plot). After this period the survival rate is almost constant until the age of 50 where it starts to drop again. This is due to the fact that the risk of dying from infectious diseases increases with age. The risk of dying from infectious diseases is particularly high in countries with a low GNP. This is because the GNP is a good indicator of the quality of the health care system. The next plot shows the correlation between GNP and life expectancy.
