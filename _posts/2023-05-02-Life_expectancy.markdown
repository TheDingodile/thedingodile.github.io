**Introduction**

Japan is currently one of the countries with the highest life expectancy of all time. The country has had an consistent growth to the top in the last 60 years. In this article we explore the global development of life expectancy with focus on Japan. Get ready for an interactive journey going from a worldwide perspective deepdiving into the fascinating story of Japan. What causes people to live longer? How has particularly Japan unlocked this potential? Is there a limit to to human longevity? 

If these questions whet the appetite, this article is for you.

**The last 60 years globally**

We start off in a broad scope by showing the global development in the last 60 years. [During this period the world-wide life expectancy has increased from 50 years to 72 years.](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/WLD/world/life-expectancy) This remarkable development is particularly due to many countries in Asia, Africa and South America catching up with the western world.

We see how drastically Africa improves over the period. Meanwhile, the countries which are leading the pack in 1960, like the Scandinavia, Australia, Japan and Canada are still at the top in 2020. However, the gap between the top and the bottom has been reduced significantly. Worth noticing is also the unparalleled improvement in China, which has gone from a life expectancy of 33 years in 1960 to 78 years in 2020. This is a remarkable improvement in only 60 years. To better illustrate the sheer magnitude of this development we made the following bar-chart.

As seen in the previous plots it would be considered lucky to live to the age of 30 in some of the undeveloped countries in Africa and even China (Which was during The Great Leap Forward) in 1960. The life expectancy in these countries is [comparable to the life expectancy in Europe in the 1800s](https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/Eng/Docs/DEIP_Gallop.pdf). Similarly to that time in Europe, the low life expectancy is due to [high infant mortality](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1072803/child-mortality-rate-africa-historical/) and a high risk of dying from infectious diseases. Clearly, if you are unfortunate enough to die as a child, you will drag down the average life expectancy by a large margin. In a country where people die at age 80 on average, it would take 4 people to live to the age of 100 just to outweight the death of one child. This next plot demonstrates how reducing infant mortality rate is the first and biggest decider when it comes to increasing life expectancy overall.

All of the relatively less developed countries, like India, Brazil and South Africa, displays the same trend of a sharp drop in survival rate for the first 5 years of a childs life in 1960. In India, for example, you would have a 20 percent chance of dying before the age of 5. This trend is similar to what is seen in Denmark around 1900 (Which also is toggle-able in the plot). After the first 5 years the survival rate is more flat until the age of around 50 where it starts to drop again. The infant mortality rate is primarly a problem for the poorest countries, and is often not the deciding factor of life expectancy between two developed countries. 





Thus, one could expect that the next major factor has to do with improving life of those over 50 years old by investing and advancing the medical field, and by building a society where everyone has access to these tools. A natural question to ask is then: Does the life expectancy of a country correlate with the wealth and health expenditure of the country? In the next section we explore this question.

**With wealth comes health?**

We now go forward to 2021 where mortality death rate

(Plot of your expected age given your current age and country of residence for 1960 and 2020)

So it would be fair to say that with wealth comes health, to some extend, and under the right circumstances.
