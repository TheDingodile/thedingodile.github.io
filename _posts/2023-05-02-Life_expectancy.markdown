**Introduction**

Japan is currently one of the countries with the highest life expectancy of all time. The country has had an consistent growth to the top in the last 60 years. In this article we explore the global development of life expectancy with focus on Japan. Get ready for an interactive journey going from a worldwide perspective deepdiving into the fascinating story of Japan. What causes people to live longer? How has particularly Japan unlocked this potential? Is there a limit to to human longevity? 

If these questions whet the appetite, this article is for you.

The life expectancy in these countries is [comparable to the life expectancy in Europe in the 1800s.](https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/Eng/Docs/DEIP_Gallop.pdf). Like the time back in Europe, the low life expectancy is due to [high infant mortality](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1072803/child-mortality-rate-africa-historical/) and a high risk of dying from infectious diseases.
